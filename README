Shell-EnvImporter version 0.01
==============================

Shell::EnvImporter allows you to import environment variables set in an external
shell script into the environment of a Perl script.  For instance, if your
ORACLE_HOME variable is set in ~oracle/.bashrc, you can use Shell::EnvImporter
to import it thus:

  my $importer = Shell::EnvImporter->new(file => glob("~oracle/.bashrc"));

This imports all variables added or changed by ~oracle/.bashrc into the
current environment (%ENV).  By using Shell::EnvImporter's advanced
features, one can exert more control over the process -- which shell is 
required, which variables are imported, etc.

Currently supported shells: bash, csh, ksh, sh, tcsh, zsh, and of course, 
perl.  :)
